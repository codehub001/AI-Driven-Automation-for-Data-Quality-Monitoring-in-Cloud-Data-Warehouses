# AI-Driven Automation for Data Quality Monitoring in Cloud Data Warehouses  

## 📌 Overview  
Ensuring high-quality data is crucial for accurate decision-making. This project leverages AI and machine learning to automate data quality monitoring in cloud data warehouses. By detecting anomalies, inconsistencies, and missing data in real time, this system enhances data integrity and reduces manual intervention.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Real-time Anomaly Detection** – Identify incorrect, missing, or inconsistent data automatically.  
✅ **Automated Data Cleansing** – AI-powered correction of errors in datasets.  
✅ **Scalability** – Efficiently monitors large datasets in cloud-based environments.  
✅ **Proactive Alerts** – Notifies users of potential data quality issues before they impact operations.  
✅ **Seamless Integration** – Compatible with cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift.  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow  
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, GCP, Azure  
- **Data Engineering**: Apache Spark, Airflow  
- **Databases**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
